# Summary of Insights

## Sales Trends
### Overall Sales Performance
- **The COVID-19 pandemic drove a sharp increase in e-commerce activity in 2020, leading to a 163% YoY sales surge** for Tech Hub. However, this growth was temporary, with sales declining in subsequent years, returning to near pre-pandemic levels by 2022.
- Even after the 2020 surge, **sales remained elevated in 2021 at $9.1M**, indicating some lasting impact of increased online shopping habits before a steeper decline in 2022.
- By 2022, sales had dropped sharply from the pandemic peak but remained about 28% higher than pre‑pandemic levels in 2019.

### Regional Sales Performance
- Despite overall sales volatility, the proportional split by region remained relatively stable, suggesting **Tech Hub hasn’t expanded significantly in specific markets**.
- **North America showed dominance contributing ~49%-55% of total sales each year**; indicating strong brand presence but also potential of overreliance in one region. 
- While all regions saw a peak in 2020, **LATAM and APAC have remained relatively small contributors**, highlighting potential opportunities for market expansion or localization strategies.
- **EMEA performance is stable but modest as the second-largest region contributing ~30% to sales yearly**. There is a potential that the region may be under-leveraged with the flat growth.

### Monthly Sales Performance
- **Each year, September shows a noticeable spike**, likely driven by back-to-school and tech-related seasonal demand (e.g., laptops and monitors).

- Loyalty member status is correctly recorded at the time of each purchase.
- Marketing channel attribution is based on last-touch or final-click data.
- External factors (e.g., COVID-19, inflation, supply chain issues) may have impacted customer behavior and sales but are not modeled directly.
- Profitability was not assessed due to lack of cost or margin data; analysis is based on revenue only.
- Customer-level segmentation (e.g., demographics, behavior) was not possible due to limited customer data.
